# Wearable and Ubiquitous Projects

This repository holds the projects and documentation for the class CSCE 5013 at the University of Arkansas (Spring 2023)

## Projects

1. [Project 1](project-1.md) - This project
introduces the students to the Arduino platform and the Arduino IDE. We need to build a simple circuit
with a push button, two LEDs, light sensor, and a servo motor. The circuit will be controlled by the
Arudino Uno R3 and connections made on a breadboard.
